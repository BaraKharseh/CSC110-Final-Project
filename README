Final project for CSC110 (Foundations of Computer Science I). This project is made in Python, utilizing pandas and plotly.

To run the project, please follow the set-up instructions in `project_report.tex`, found under "Instructions".

This project visualizes the change between two groups of worker data (particularly staffing descisions) gathered by the government of Canada on different times during
the COVID-19 pandemic. This change is displayed either graphically or on a choropleth map of the country.

Our datasets are divided into various categories by statistic and region. The data from the earlier date is compared to the later using multiple algorithms. When 
visualized, blue represents a positive change, and red represents a negative one, with stronger tones indicating a stronger directional increase in change.

The user controls exactly which type of comparison is shown (ex. number of businesses that laid off staff) and how it is grouped (by province/territory, by industry, 
or by size). If choosing provinces/territories, they also have option to display the comparison on a choropleth map instead of a double bar graph.
